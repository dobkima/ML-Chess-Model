# Chess Move Prediction

This repository contains code for the custom components used in an Azure Machine Learning pipeline for a model trained to predict the most likely human move 
for any given chess position. The model is based on a deep neural network, trained on a dataset of millions of human-played chess positions of different skill ratings.

## Data
The dataset used for training and testing the model is a collection of human-played chess games in the PGN format. The dataset can be downloaded
